I am a bioinformatics researcher with interests in data governance and management, meta-analysis, integrated omics and systems biology. My goal is to lead data management practices and develop data management solutions that maximize the potential of heterogeneous data to transform biomedicine. 

With over four years' experience supporting organizations' ISO 9001 or FDA and cGMP compliance as a quality assurance professional, I currently focus on developing computational tools for metadata capture, management and sharing with use-cases in metabolomics. I am especially interested in advancing metadata quality and integrity with consideration towards FAIR principles and regulatory compliance. 

Presently, I am a Bioinformatics PhD student and Graduate Research Assistant in the Edison Lab at the University of Georgia. Post-graudation, I plan to pursue my research interests within an industrial organization or federal agency.
