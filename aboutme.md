I am a bioinformatics researcher with interests in data governance and management, meta-analysis, integrated omics and systems biology. My goal is to lead data management practices and develop data management solutions that maximize the potential of heterogeneous data to transform biomedicine. 

Presently, I am a Bioinformatics PhD student and Graduate Research Assistant in the Edison Lab at the University of Georgia. With over four years' experience supporting organizations' ISO 9001 or FDA and cGMP compliance as a quality assurance professional, I currently focus on developing computational tools for metadata capture, management and sharing with use-cases in metabolomics. I am especially interested in advancing metadata quality and integrity with consideration towards FAIR principles and regulatory compliance. 

Postgraduation, I am eager to interface among principal investigators and research teams within industry or government. With a focus on metadata management, data lineage and data quality, I hope to lead the design and implementation of data acquisition, processing, distribution, archiving and integration efforts.
